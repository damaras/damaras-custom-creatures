Like golems, they have no real minds of their own, but rather follow orders and programming instilled within them by more powerful devils. In the case of multiple orders, only the orders of the most powerful devil are followed. They can utilize simple weapons if commanded, attacking with proficiency, and can also manipulate simple objects like doors. Armor, more complex weapons, and complex tools are beyond their ability to comprehend."},{"id":"_9hb16awn6s","name":"Attack of Opportunity","traits":"","range":"","actions":"reaction","type":"offense","description":""}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"le","size":"medium","type":"fiend","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"Longspear","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":3,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":0,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"constitution":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":-4,"benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":0,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":16,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"hp":{"value":16,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":9,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"3 physical (except silver)","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"3 good","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"fire, mental","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"soldier","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_1rtr4nszul0","name":"Longspear","traits":"reach 10 ft.","attack":8,"damage":"1d8 piercing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_2htawk7hy5g","name":"claw","traits":"agile, finesse","attack":8,"damage":"1d4 slashing plus 1 evil","type":"Melee"}],"tags":[]}
