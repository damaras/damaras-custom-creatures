The glass bowl itself is in fact a part of its body, and it's soft and warm to the touch, but usually is too late for anyone that notices this fact. The \"goldfish\" inside is actually the head of the creature, and it can spring forward to bite its prey with a very large mouth filled with razor sharp teeth, much like a piranha.\nWhen it's digesting a prey the \"water\" inside the bowl turns a murky red, as bits and pieces of the last meal it's had can bee seen swirling around. After about a day the digestion process is complete, and its body become crystal clear once again.\nRumors say that unscrupulous wizards create them only to be sold as exotic \"pets\", changing the appearance of the bowl and the fish inside every time so that those who are aware of the existance of this creature can never be sure of what they're seeing before is too late.\nGiven its peculiar appearence, it uses its cunning to exploit a simpleton in doing its bidding, making the person in question carrying them around so that it feed off its unsuspecting preys.\nIt can also be found at some questionable sideshows, where is exploited by ruthless conmen advertising their collection of incredible animals to easily collect valuables off the dead.\nThey can seldom be found in the wilds, where this disguise is not very effective, and thus have the tendency to avoid rural settings.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":17,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"5 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"occult","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","","Daze, Ghost Sound, Prestidigitation"],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":-1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":1,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":3,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":3,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":10,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":10,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":7,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":10,"benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":6,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":15,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":20,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":4,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":7,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":10,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_1tb9jmfz67r","name":"bite","traits":"agile, finesse, deadly d8","attack":9,"damage":"1d6-1 piercing plus grab","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"common"}
